                    Situated in the heart of England, the land of ecology pioneers, company specializes in
                    establishing
                    cooperation between investors and local engineering companies on a global level.

                    Its main activity
                    areas include building renewable energy power plants, organizing technical equipment maintenance
                    and
                    dealing with legal authorities. As the company grew in time it seemed natural to expand our
                    horizons
                    and create more sustainability value on a global scale. This goal of ours to create an
                    innovative
                    way to solve everyday problems resulted in the Amperium platform. The name Amperium comes from a
                    global standard unit of electrical measurement and a system which combines multiple objects and
                    factors towards a single purpose. This resembles company’s features value in many ways. Amperium
                    allows for easy access to sustainable energy and relatable technology within the public sector.
                    Amperium's mission is to create a global sustainability oriented infrastructure that is for
                    everyone. This way the organization can focus on being renewable energy technology community
                    leaders.

                                combining solar, wind and hydro energy together there’s a possibility of creating an

                    Amperium aims to establish multiple sustainability oriented projects that will improve both
                    quality of life for many and increases value of a company
                </p>
                <p>Take a look at our road map for upcoming years. We have big plans for upcoming three decades. 2020 is
                    the year that we go public with Amperium brand, this will enable private sector users to part take
                    in establishing renewable energy power plants no mater where they live. As a result Amperium creates
                    new option to invest and receive periodic dividends from green energy niche. Next decade we are
                    pushing electric vehicle transportation to mega cities. Amperium team believes to have an answer
                    that will greatly improve user experience with electric vehicles. The ultimate goal of Amperium is
                    to build world’s biggest and most eco friendly geothermal power plant. Why? Since geothermal power
                    plats are closest to zero emission. One geothermal plant can supply a medium size country with no
                    risk of radio active meltdown. </p>

                                <p>Since day one founders of Amperium are moving forward towards building one of a
                                    biggest and most efficient geothermal power plants ever built. Geothermal power
                                    plant will not only bring economically friendly electricity prices to region, but
                                    will also create favourable environment for electric vehicles industry to expand.
                                    History has showed that although nuclear energy is efficient and rather cheap, but
                                    highly unstable and produces nuclear waste. To this day, there is no cleaner energy
                                    in the long run like geothermal power plant. Geothermal power plant runs on water
                                    steam turbines. We dig in so deep that the natural temperature of earth crust heats
                                    up water to a steaming point and propels turbines, water then cools down in
                                    condensation chambers and the cycle repeats. This is simple, efficient way of
                                    producing electricity.</p>

                                    stations’ subscriber uses a customized vehicle that has modular battery cells which
                                    can be instantly replaced with a fully charged cell leaving the empty one to charge
                                    in the stand. This solves the continuous mobility problem with electric vehicles.
                                    They can move long distances without having to worry about recharging the batteries
                                    now, because of sharing stations being a thing. This system will revolutionize
                                    mobility in zero emission zones and turn the world’s most densely populated mega
                                    cities into smart cities of carbon free energy and air.
